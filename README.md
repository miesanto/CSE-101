# Hello!
Welcome to my Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms repository, which contains all eight solo assignments from Fall 2023! I happily finished with a **__`91%`__** (including exams). We covered linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs.

# Note
I hope to add the corresponding Makefiles and READMEs as soon as I finish altering them (and eventually the grading scripts and example input/output documents). I apologize for the lack of context thus far!
